# 🤝 Toronto Poverty Management – Predictive Engagement and Outcome Modeling

This repository contains the data analysis and modeling work carried out in collaboration with **Toronto Poverty Management**, a non-profit organization dedicated to alleviating poverty and creating a more inclusive, equitable society. Our work explores how data can be used to predict engagement, optimize interventions, and drive meaningful change for underserved communities.

## 🧠 Project Overview

A central question drives the analytical journey in this project:  
**How can we use data to identify, understand, and better serve vulnerable individuals at risk of disengagement or reduced outcomes?**

We focused on answering key business questions:

- 🔍 How can we **identify participants at risk** of decreased engagement and **predict future Scaled TIMES Scores** to enable proactive, personalized support?
- 🧪 What is the relationship between **Secret Sauce** variables and **TIME Scores** across various clusters or demographic segments?
- 👥 How do **demographic factors** influence program engagement and participant outcomes?
- 📊 How can we **predict success rates** of clustered participant groups for smarter intervention planning?

---

## 🔬 Methodology

To explore these questions, we implemented the following techniques:

### 🔁 Predictive Modeling
- **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression** models were used to:
  - Forecast participant outcomes (Scaled TIMES Scores)
  - Predict likelihood of disengagement
  - Support real-time decision-making for support teams

### 👥 Clustering Analysis
- Grouped participants based on **shared traits and behavioral patterns**
- Allowed for **tailored interventions** per cluster
- Analyzed success rate and impact variance across groups

### 📈 Feature Exploration
- Explored how the **"Secret Sauce"** metrics and demographic features influence scores and outcomes
- Evaluated which variables are **most predictive** of success or risk

## 💡 Key Insights

- Our models enabled **early identification** of at-risk individuals, improving the chances of timely intervention.
- Clustering revealed **unique behavioral profiles** that helped refine and personalize outreach strategies.
- Certain demographic variables had significant correlations with program engagement, highlighting areas for **equity-based program design**.
- The predictive tools developed can now help **forecast** program outcomes with higher precision and scalability.
